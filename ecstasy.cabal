name:                ecstasy
version:             0.2.1.0
synopsis:
  A GHC.Generics based entity component system.

description:
  Ecstasy is an entity-component system for Haskell. It's inspired by
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apecs apecs>, but makes the design
  decision to focus on being idiomatic rather than being fast. Maybe. I haven't
  actually benchmarked it.
  .
  We achieve being idiomatic by using 'GHC.Generics' and tricky type families
  to derive performant data stores given only a record of the desired
  components.
