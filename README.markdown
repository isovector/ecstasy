## Dedication

> when I see things like this, there’s nothing better than the underlying
> feeling that I’m a part of something good, some incredible positive vibration
> that we’re somehow all spinning around on. There’s nothing better than to
> think about all those people who are worried about me, and to understand
> they’re concerned, fundamentally, out of love. There’s nothing better than to
> know that there’s people who care that much. But, most of all, there’s nothing
> to better than to know that those people are wrong. Am I out of control? Fuck
> no, I’m a goddamn Jedi. That’s as in control as it gets.
