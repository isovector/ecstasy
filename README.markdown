## Overview

Ecstasy is an *entity-component system* for Haskell. It's inspired by
[apecs][apecs], but makes the design decision to focus on being idiomatic rather
than being fast. Maybe. I haven't actually benchmarked it.

We achieve being idiomatic by using GHC.Generics and tricky type families to
derive performant data stores given only a record of the desired components.
